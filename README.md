Clicking an item in the navigation bar directs the user to cards with additional information and images describing their services.  There is an aside element to the right with a card highlighting the benefits customers experience when using Horiseon.  These cards are also accessible by scrolling down the page.

At the bottom of the page is a footer that shows Horiseon's legal name and a wholesome shoutout to the dev team.
